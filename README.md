# M4-Diamonds
This is Coursera programming assignment 2 of Android Development Specialization.
## Introduction
In this assignment, you are to write Java code that produce an ASCII art picture that varies in
size based upon input given by the user.
## Learning Outcomes
After completing this assignment, you will have experience with:
1. Writing loops that repeat some computation a specified number of times.
2. Writing conditional statements that alter the execution of your program based upon various criteria.
3. Writing methods that accept parameters to eliminate or reduce redundant code in your program.
## Tasks
In this assignment, you are to write a program that will print an ASCII art drawing of a diamond
in a picture frame that will be displayed on the screen of your Android device in a text box. You
should exactly reproduce the format of the output samples below. This includes having identical
characters and spacing. One way to write a Java program to draw this figure would be to write a
println() statement that prints each line of the figure. However, this solution would not
receive full credit. A major part of this assignment is showing that you understand for loops
and if statements.

Another significant component of this assignment is the task of generalizing the program using a
variable to adjust the size of the figure. When the program is run, the user will select the size of
the figure they want produced. You are provided with code that accesses that value and passes it
to the method named process() in the integer parameter named size. Your code should be
written in terms of the parameter size so that it produces the correctly sized figure.

Here are four sample outputs of the program, with diamonds of size 1, 2, 4, and 7 respectively.
Sample outputs:
* Size 1:
```
    +--+
    |<>|
    +--+
```
* Size 2:
```
    +----+
    | /\ |
    |<-->|
    | \/ |
    +----+
```
* Size 4:
```
    +--------+
    |   /\   |
    |  /--\  |
    | /====\ |
    |<------>|
    | \====/ |
    |  \--/  |
    |   \/   |
    +--------+
```
* Size 7:
```
    +--------------+
    |      /\      |
    |     /--\     |
    |    /====\    |
    |   /------\   |
    |  /========\  |
    | /----------\ |
    |<============>|
    | \----------/ |
    |  \========/  |
    |   \------/   |
    |    \====/    |
    |     \--/     |
    |      \/      |
    +--------------+
```
Besides the top and bottom of the picture frame, each line of the diagram consists of the
following:
1. The left side of the picture frame, followed by
2. Some number of spaces (including zero spaces on the line in the center), followed by
3. A forward slash ‘/’ if on the top half of the diamond or a back slash ‘\’ if on the bottom half of the diamond, or a left angle bracket ‘<’ if at the center of the diamond, followed by
4. Some number of hyphens ‘-’ or equal signs ‘=’ depending upon whether it was an even or odd line, followed by
5. A back slash ‘\’ if on the top half of the diamond or a forward slash ‘/’ if on the bottom half of the diamond, or a right angle bracket ‘>’ if at the center of the diamond, followed by
6. Some number of spaces, followed by
7. The right side of the picture frame.

Each and every line of the diagram should end with a newline character. Be sure not to have any
blank spaces before or after each line of the diagram. Be sure not to have any extra blank lines
before or after the diagram.

On any given execution, your program will produce just one version of the figure. However, you
should refer to the variable size throughout your code, so that when a user enters a different
value, your program would produce a figure of a different size. Your program should scale
correctly for any size value of 1 or greater (regardless of the fact that the app only allows you
to choose sizes 1 thru 8).

Another significant component of this assignment is the task of recognizing or identifying
sections of code that are identical (or redundant) in different parts of your program, and
eliminating that redundancy by defining a method that contains that code and then calling the
method from the appropriate points.

Use of for-loops: This program is intended to test your knowledge of for-loops and conditionals.
Some code will need to test whether you are printing an even numbered line or an odd numbered
line. You can use the modulo division operator ‘%’ and test the remainder after division by two.
For full credit, you should also create helper methods that can handle common or redundant tasks
for you.

Source code aesthetics (commenting, indentation, spacing, identifier names): You are required to
properly indent your code and will lose points if you make significant indentation mistakes. No
line of your code should be over 100 characters long (even better is limiting lines to 80
characters). You should use a consistent programming style. 

This should include the following.
* Create helper method as needed
* Meaningful variable & method names
* Consistent indenting
* Use of "white-space" and blank lines to make the code more readable
* Use of comments to explain pieces of tricky code
